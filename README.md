## Getting Started
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/xyarim/android-architecture.git
```

## Libraries

### Android Jetpack

* [DataBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.

* [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.

* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.

* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.

* [NavigationComponent](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) Android Jetpack's Navigation component helps you implement navigation, from simple button clicks to more complex patterns, such as app bars and the navigation drawer. 
### HTTP

* [Retrofit2](https://github.com/square/retrofit) Type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java by Square, Inc.

* [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp) An HTTP+HTTP/2 client for Android and Java applications.

* [Kotlin Coroutine Adapter](https://github.com/JakeWharton/retrofit2-kotlin-coroutines-adapter) A Retrofit 2 adapter for Kotlin coroutine's Deferred type.


### Coroutines

* [Kotlin Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) Coroutines is a rich library for coroutines developed by JetBrains. It contains a number of high-level coroutine-enabled primitives that this guide covers, including launch, async and others.
### DI

* [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) A pragmatic lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin developers.
### UI

* [Avatar View](https://github.com/TangoAgency/avatar-view) Avatar ImageView with user's name first letter Drawable placeholder
### TODO

* Implement Repository pattern
